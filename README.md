# FinanceAssistant

Simple app (still in progress) created in purpose of learning new technologies - .NET Core & Angular.

So far, the application supports functionalities such as creating, updating and deleting transactions and transaction categories, filtering existing data by type or category, displaying transactions (pie charts) for chosen dates in HRK or EUR... In the background, I'm using HNB API for exchange rate conversion.
